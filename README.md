# CP-Makefile
This is a Competetive Programming Boilerplate for writing competetive programming code:

input.txt:
- place to copy in inputs or change them yourself
- piped into code.cpp

code.cpp:
- cpp file containing the code
- takes in inputs from input.txt and outputs in terminal

Makefile:
- Compiles the input into the code.cpp file
- Creates the ./run executable which runs the code
